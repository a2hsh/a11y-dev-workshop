# A11y Dev Workshop

This starter template intentionally includes common accessibility issues. It is used in a workshop to practice auditing and fixing problems such as missing alt text, poor color contrast, nonâ€‘semantic markup and incomplete form labels.
The app features a simple login flow and a news feed where articles can be added or removed after authentication.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the application at `http://localhost:5173` and explore the page using keyboard and assistive technologies. You will notice several accessibility barriers that will be addressed during the workshop.
